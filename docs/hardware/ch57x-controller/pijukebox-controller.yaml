# PiJukebox Controller Configuration - Arrow Keys for Volume
# Modified: 2025-11-21
# Reason: Browser cannot receive System Volume Keys (volumeup/volumedown/mute)
#
# 3×1 controller with 1 rotary knob (PiJukebox setup)
# VBESTLIFE Macro-Keyboard with Red Switch (3 Keys 1 Knob)
#
# Physical button layout:
#   Key 1 (left): "r" → Next track
#   Key 2 (middle): "e" → Pause/Play toggle
#   Key 3 (right): "w" → Previous track
#
# KeyboardManager code mapping:
#   W key → Previous track (onPrevious)
#   E key → Pause/Play (onPausePlay)
#   R key → Next track (onNext)
#   Arrow Up → Volume up (onVolumeUp)
#   Arrow Down → Volume down (onVolumeDown)
#   Space → Mute/Unmute (onMute)
#
# Knob actions (CHANGED - now uses Arrow Keys):
#   Rotate Counter-clockwise → Arrow Down (Volume down)
#   Rotate Clockwise → Arrow Up (Volume up)
#   Press → Space (Mute/Unmute)
#
# WHY ARROW KEYS?
# - Browser CAN receive Arrow keys (unlike system volume keys)
# - Intuitive: Up = louder, Down = quieter
# - Works with normal keyboard as backup control
#
# NOTE: No KC_ prefix! Use lowercase keycode names from `ch57x-keyboard-tool show-keys`
