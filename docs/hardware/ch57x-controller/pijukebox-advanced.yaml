# PiJukebox Advanced Controller Configuration
# Alternative configuration using media keys instead of letter keys
# 3×1 controller with 1 rotary knob
#
# This configuration uses dedicated media control keys for playback,
# which work system-wide without application focus.
#
# NOTE: PiJukebox's KeyboardManager expects W/E/R keys by default.
# Use this configuration only if you modify KeyboardManager to listen
# for media keys, or for system-wide media control outside PiJukebox.
