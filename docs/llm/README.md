# LLM Development Guidelines

This directory contains documentation specifically designed for AI coding assistants (LLMs) working on this project.

## Purpose

These documents provide context, coding standards, and best practices to ensure consistent, high-quality contributions from AI assistants like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and others.

## Files

- **[AGEND.md](./AGEND.md)** - Primary development guidelines, coding standards, and workflows
- **README.md** (this file) - Overview of LLM documentation

## For Human Developers

While these documents are optimized for LLM consumption, they also serve as:

- Quick reference for project architecture
- Coding standards documentation
- Development workflow guidelines

Feel free to reference these when contributing to the project.

## For AI Assistants

Please read **[AGEND.md](./AGEND.md)** before making any code changes. It contains:

- Project architecture overview
- Tech stack details
- Coding standards (TypeScript, Svelte 5, Clean Code)
- Git workflow and commit conventions
- Hardware context (Raspberry Pi, RFID, USB controllers)
- Common pitfalls and best practices

## Usage

When an AI assistant starts working on this project, it should:

1. Read this README for context
2. Study AGEND.md for development guidelines
3. Refer back to AGEND.md when making architectural decisions
4. Follow the documented patterns and standards

## Contributing

If you're a human developer improving these guidelines:

- Keep language clear and directive for LLMs
- Use examples liberally
- Update AGEND.md when architecture changes
- Keep formatting consistent (Markdown with code blocks)

**Note:** This directory is tracked in git to ensure all contributors (human and AI) have access to the same guidelines.
